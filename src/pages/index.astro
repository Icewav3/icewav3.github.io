    <!--mission statement-->
    <p>
        I leverage my technical expertise in Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot paired with my experience with project
        management to work collaboratively in team settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am committed to deep game design principles, I focus on creating balanced, player-centric games that maintain
        intrinsic fun and challenge human tendency to over-optimize gameplay.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am constantly learning to improve my craft, and seek out opportunities to further my understanding and
        technical skills.
