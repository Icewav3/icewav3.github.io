            This project was eye-opening for me as we had created it entirely
            from scratch and without a game engine. Which highlights the
            amount of work game engines do for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing this project really made me realize how closely my code
            standards are connected to the allotted scope and timeframe for a
            project.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, things not included in the initial scope added much
            more complexity as infrastructure was not designed to support them.
            As those things are added they are also exponentially increase the
            complexity as they are closer to being duct taped on rather than
            built into the foundation. Which really highlights the importance of
            not taking shortcuts in large scope and long term projects. If you
            need to refactor a bunch of base classes to allow for a new feature,
            you should base the decision on the project's scope and expected
            lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also made me realize how my standards change in different
            settings, my documentation was great at first
            but later I found myself allotting less and less time to
            documenting. In contrast to when I know others will have to use and
            understand my code, I make sure to meticulously document everything
            and adhere to code standards.
