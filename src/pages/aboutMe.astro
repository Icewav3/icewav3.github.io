        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Cole Dorman, I am a
            <a href="https://www.rrc.ca/">Red River College</a>
            student who started my journey with
            <a href="https://catalogue.rrc.ca/Programs/WPG/Fulltime/DATSF-DP">Data
                Science and machine learning</a>
            where I learned the immense value of statistics and how important
            they are to any project's success.

            as well as leading projects in our class.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about all facets of game development, from design to
            programming. I have experience
            in both Unity and Unreal Engine, and I am currently learning C# and
            C++.
            <!--edit this: I need to make it more apparent that I am very capable of-->
            <!--all the difficult parts of project management - such as scope-->
            <!--cutting/conflict resolution-->
            I also enjoy aspects of project management, as it's very rewarding
            to help everyone come
            together to create something great.

            I believe balancing is an extremely core component of any game, and
            without it even games filled with
            content can feel empty. I also believe it is the developer's job to
            account for human nature of
            tending to "optimize the fun out of games", and I try to bring that
            into my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy playing board games or video games, as well
            as mountain biking & trail riding.
            Beyond those I also enjoy hiking and the scent of the forest.
