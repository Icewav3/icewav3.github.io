            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Cole Dorman, I am currently a
                <a href="https://www.rrc.ca/">Red River College</a>
                student studying
                <a href="https://www.rrc.ca/explore/program/game-development-programming/">Game Development</a>
                as well as leading projects in our class.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about all facets of game development, from design to programming. I have experience
                in both Unity and Unreal Engine, and I am currently learning C# and C++. I also enjoy aspects of
                project management, as it's very rewarding to help everyone come together to create something great.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe balancing is an extremely core component of any game, and without it even games filled with
                content can feel empty. I also believe it is the developer's job to account for human nature of
                tending to "optimize the fun out of games", and I try to bring that into my projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I enjoy playing board games or video games, as well as mountain biking & trail riding.
                Beyond those I also enjoy hiking and the scent of forest.
